from flask import Flask, request, url_for, render_template
# Imported 4 very basic necessary modules to build a flask app

# Flask - to register the flask and deploy it on a local server
# request - to handle the incoming, GET,POST,PUT,DELETE request
# url_for -  to locate static files (css,js) on server
# render_template - to fetch the required HTML template at the corresponding url

# NOOTE: INCASE, OUR APP IS ONLY BACKEND-BASED, that is no, front-end is required then, Use only "Flask" & "request"

import json

# STEP 1: initiate your app
app = Flask(__name__)

# STEP 2: now, setup your routing URLs. ROUTING URLS, are URL patterns on which diffent operations of the app performs.


# "/", that means we are setting up the HOME PAGE , what will occur on the landing on the home page.
@app.route("/")
def home():  # Now were defining the function, which will run on landing on the home page
    return json.dumps({"status": "1", "message": "You are successfully landed on the home page"})


# I can specify that, which request method to be used for this particular URL
@app.route("/url2", methods=["GET"])
def url2():
    return json.dumps({"status": "1", "message": "Successfully landed on url2 which is accepts only GET requests"})


@app.route("/url3", methods=["POST"])
def url3():
    return json.dumps({"status": "1", "message": "Successfully landed on url3 which is accepts only POST requests"})
    # if you see "METHOD NOT ALLOWED" on browser, then don;t woryy, because, browser only makes GET requests by default


@app.route("/url4", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def url4():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return json.dumps({"status": "1", "message": "Successfully landed on url4 which is accepts both requests, but NOW your made a GET request"})
    else:
        return json.dumps({"status": "1", "message": "Successfully landed on url4 which is accepts both requests, but NOW your made a POST request"})

# STEP 3: Now, since I've setted up my routing URLS, now its the time to run the app
# Don't Panic, No more steps, this is the last one


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # run the app, debug is TRUE in development mode, so that any error while developing the error can be solved
    app.run(debug=True)
